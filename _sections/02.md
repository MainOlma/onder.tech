We can influence on energy consumption of smart devices by changing the energy price. These kinds of adjustments lower the network load.
The faster does the price react to changing demand, the lower is the peak load. In the ØNDER network, price can be updated every five seconds, so pricing policy becomes flexible.
With ØNDER suppliers and consumers can find balance of energy price, quantity and quality faster, and can choose priority of utilization for different types of energy sources.
